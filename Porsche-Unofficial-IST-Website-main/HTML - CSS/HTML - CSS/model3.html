      <p class="aesborder">
        The Porsche Taycan Car Model is a groundbreaking innovation <br>
        as it is Porsche's introduction of their first ever <br>
        all-electric sports car, marking a new era for Porsche. The <br>
        Taycan still delivers the speed and remarkable performance <br>
        that Porsche always aspires and accomplishes to give, but <br>
        also has a brand new elegant design, incredible handling <br>
        and acceleration. The model also has fast charging, helping <br>
        to redefine electric vehicles. It can hence be said that <br>
        this car is for anybody who wants to be sustainable, reduce <br>
        carbon emissions and have a high performing car of the future.
